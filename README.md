# Chaos Cards

## What?

Chaos Cards is a flash cards app. And the default deck contains 7 flash cards for how to say each day of the week in Thai.

## Why?

I built Chaos Cards out of frustration of not being able to recall the days of the week in my parents' language: the Thai language ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­. My aunties in Thailand don't speak any English and would often ask me "when are you taking your mom to the doctor?" "when will her friend pick her up?" And I would just stumble trying to recall how to say Wednesday (it's "wan put", Theo).

## How is it different?

The main value of the app was to have it interrupt your day with a notification, because aunties never wait until you're ready. They come when you least expect (hence Chaos).

Each notification will contain a multiple-choice quiz question like "how do you say Wednesday?"

You can answer within the notification by long pressing it and choosing from 3 choices -- 1 of which is correct. All wrong choices are picked at random from other cards in your flash card deck.

After answering a notification, you'll be presented immediately with another question via notification until all questions from your deck were presented. So a card deck of 7 cards would mean 7 notifications.
